## OKR Best Practices

**Good Objectives:**
- Qualitative and inspirational
- Time-bound (quarterly)
- Team can influence outcome

**Good Key Results:**
- Measurable (number)
- Ambitious but achievable
- Outcome-focused, not task-focused

**Examples:**

❌ Bad: Ship dark mode (task)  
✅ Good: Increase D7 retention from 40% to 55% (outcome)

❌ Bad: Improve user experience (vague)  
✅ Good: Reduce time-to-first-value from 10 min to 3 min (measurable)

**70% Rule:** Aim for 70% completion. 100% means you weren't ambitious enough.
