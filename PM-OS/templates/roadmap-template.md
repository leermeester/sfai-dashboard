# Product Roadmap Template

Your strategic communication tool for aligning teams and stakeholders.

## Why Roadmaps Matter

"The format matters as much as the content. A poorly communicated roadmap leads to misaligned teams, confused stakeholders, and missed opportunities." - Aakash Gupta

**Choose format based on audience:**
- Executive: High-level themes, business outcomes
- Engineering: Timeline, dependencies
- Sales/Marketing: Features, launch dates
- Design: User value, experience improvements

## Example: Real Roadmap

### Q1 2026 Product Roadmap - [Product Name]

**Strategic Focus:** Enable enterprise adoption

**NOW (Jan-Mar 2026)**

**🔒 Enterprise-Ready**
Why: 60% of pipeline requires these features

- SSO/SAML integration (8 weeks) → Unblocks $2M pipeline
- Advanced permissions (6 weeks) → Required by 70% of enterprise trials
- Audit logs (3 weeks) → Compliance requirement
- Status: On track for March launch

**📊 Data & Insights**
Why: Users can't prove ROI to leadership

- Advanced analytics dashboard (4 weeks) → Requested by 50% of customers
- Custom reports (3 weeks) → Enable customer success conversations
- Status: In progress, launching February

**NEXT (Apr-Jun 2026)**

**🔗 Integrations**
- Salesforce integration → 40% of prospects requested
- Slack notifications → Improve engagement
- API rate limiting → Technical necessity

**LATER (Exploring)**

- Mobile app redesign → High user demand but not enterprise blocker
- AI-powered insights → Interesting but unproven ROI
- Custom branding → Nice-to-have for enterprise

**NOT DOING:**
- Bulk operations → Enterprise doesn't need this
- Social features → Not strategic focus
