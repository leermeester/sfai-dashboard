## Design Decisions

- Using shadcn/ui defaults for v1
- Sidebar navigation layout
- Card-based metric display on overview
- Table-heavy data presentation (revenue matrix, margins, team roster)
- Recharts for all chart components

## Process

Before implementing UI changes:
1. Check this file for latest design links
2. Flag any deviation from designs in this file
3. Update this file when designs change

> **Reminder**: Figma designs must align with the roadmap (`roadmap.md`). Designs outside roadmap deliverables should be flagged.
