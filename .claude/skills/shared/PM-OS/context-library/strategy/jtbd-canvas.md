# Jobs-to-be-Done Canvas 2.0

**Purpose:** Framework for understanding what "job" customers hire your product to do. Use when defining product strategy or analyzing user needs.

## The Core Concept

**Key Insight:** People don't buy products, they "hire" them to get a job done.

**Example:** No one wants a drill, they want a hole in the wall. Actually, they want to hang a picture. Actually, they want their home to feel personalized.

**The real job:** "Help me feel like this space is mine" ← Target this, not the drill

## JTBD Statement Format

```
When [situation],
I want to [motivation],
So I can [desired outcome].
```

**Example: Uber**
```
When I need to get somewhere and don't have a car,
I want to request a ride instantly,
So I can arrive on time without the hassle of parking or public transit.
```

## The Job Layers

### 1. Functional Job
**What:** The practical task to accomplish
**Example:** Get from Point A to Point B

### 2. Emotional Job
**What:** How the user wants to feel
**Example:** Feel in control of my time, not stressed about being late

### 3. Social Job
**What:** How the user wants to be perceived
**Example:** Appear professional (arrive on time to meetings)

**Best products solve all three layers**

## Forces Diagram (Push vs Pull)

### Push Forces (toward switching)
- Pain of current solution
- Magnitude of problem
- Frequency of problem

### Pull Forces (toward your solution)
- Appeal of new solution
- Benefits of switching

### Anxieties (resist switching)
- What if it doesn't work?
- What if I waste money/time?
- Learning curve concerns

### Habits (resist switching)
- "Current solution is good enough"
- Inertia and routine
- Already invested in existing tools

**Your product must overcome (Push + Pull) > (Anxieties + Habits)**

## How to Use JTBD

### In User Research
Ask:
- "Walk me through the last time you [did this job]"
- "What were you trying to accomplish?"
- "What went wrong? What was frustrating?"
- "What did you hire to solve this? Why that solution?"

Don't ask:
- "What features do you want?" (They'll design bad solutions)
- "Would you use this?" (Future predictions are unreliable)

### In Product Strategy
1. Identify the job to be done (not the feature request)
2. Map competing solutions (what else do users "hire"?)
3. Find underserved needs (where do current solutions fail?)
4. Design for the complete job (functional + emotional + social)

### In PRDs
Frame the problem as a job:
```
**User Job:** When I'm in a meeting and someone mentions an action item, I want to capture it instantly without disrupting the conversation, so I can ensure I follow through on commitments.

**Existing Solutions:**
- Write in notebook (loses context, needs manual transfer)
- Voice memo (never transcribed, forgotten)
- Ask assistant to follow up (requires assistant, social cost)

**Our Solution:** [Describe how your feature solves the job better]
```

## Competing Against Non-Consumption

**Insight:** Your biggest competitor isn't another product—it's people doing nothing.

**Example:** Canva's real competition wasn't Photoshop, it was "I just won't make a poster."

**Implication:** Make your product:
1. Easy enough for non-experts
2. Fast enough for tight deadlines
3. Cheap enough to justify the effort

---

## Job Stories vs User Stories

**Traditional User Story:**
```
As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]
```

**Job Story (JTBD):**
```
When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]
```

**Why Job Stories are better:**
- Focus on context, not demographics
- Describes the situation that triggers the need
- Solution-agnostic (doesn't assume the feature)

## Quick Reference

**When to use JTBD:**
- ✅ Defining product strategy
- ✅ User research planning
- ✅ Identifying underserved markets
- ✅ Competitive positioning
- ✅ Framing problems in PRDs

**When NOT to use JTBD:**
- ❌ Optimizing existing features (use A/B testing instead)
- ❌ Detailed UI design (use usability testing)
- ❌ Technical architecture (different framework needed)
