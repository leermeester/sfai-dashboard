## Interview Guide

### Opening (5 minutes)

**Set the tone:**

```
Hi [Name], thanks so much for joining me today.

Just so you know, I'm not here to sell you anything or convince you of anything. I'm genuinely here to learn about your experience with [topic/product].

There are no right or wrong answers - in fact, the most valuable thing you can give me is brutally honest feedback. If something is confusing, frustrating, or doesn't work for you, that's exactly what I need to hear.

I haven't designed most of what we'll talk about, so please be as candid as possible.

Do you mind if I record this session for my internal notes? The recording stays private and is just so I can focus on listening rather than frantically typing.

[Wait for consent]

Great. Let's start with some context about you...
```

### Context Setting (10 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand their world before diving into specific topics.

Ask about:
- Their role and day-to-day responsibilities
- How they currently solve [the problem space]
- Their broader workflow and tools

**Example questions:**

- "Walk me through a typical [Monday/workday/workflow]."
- "What tools do you use regularly? How do they fit together?"
- "How did you end up in this role? What's your background?"

**What to listen for:**
- Their actual workflow (not idealized)
- Pain points they mention casually
- Workarounds they've built
- Language they use to describe problems

---

### Main Discussion (35 minutes)

**Remember: Ask about the past, not the future.**

❌ **Don't ask:** "Would you use a feature that does X?"  
✅ **Do ask:** "Tell me about the last time you tried to do X. What happened?"

❌ **Don't ask:** "What features do you want?"  
✅ **Do ask:** "Walk me through the last time you were frustrated with [process]. What made it hard?"

❌ **Don't ask:** "How do you feel about this design?"  
✅ **Do ask:** "Try to complete [specific task] using this. Talk me through what you're thinking as you go."

#### Topic 1: [Primary Research Question]

**Opening question:**
"Tell me about the last time you [encountered this problem]. Walk me through it step by step."

**Follow-up probes:**
- "What was the hardest part of that experience?"
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What did you do to work around it?"
- "How often does this happen?"
- "What would happen if you couldn't solve it?"

**Watch for:**
- Specific stories (not generalizations)
- Emotion (frustration, delight, confusion)
- Workarounds (signs of unmet needs)
- Time spent on the problem
- Who else is involved

#### Topic 2: [Secondary Research Question]

[Repeat the same structure]

#### Topic 3: [If Using a Prototype/Demo]

**Opening:**
"I'm going to show you something we're exploring. Remember, this is very early and rough - there are no wrong reactions."

**Task-based testing:**
"Imagine you wanted to [specific task]. Try to do that using this and talk out loud about what you're thinking."

**Stay silent.** Let them struggle. Resist the urge to help.

**After they complete (or give up):**
- "What was that experience like?"
- "What did you expect to happen when you clicked [X]?"
- "Was anything confusing?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand and change one thing, what would it be?"

**Watch for:**
- Where they hesitate or pause
- Where they click/tap (or try to)
- When they talk themselves through something
- Facial expressions of confusion or frustration
- What they completely miss or ignore

---

### Closing (10 minutes)

**Wrap up questions:**

"We've covered a lot. A few final questions:"

1. **"What haven't I asked about that I should have?"**
   - Often surfaces the most important insights

2. **"If you could fix one thing about [product/process], what would it be?"**
   - Gets at their top priority

3. **"Who else do you think I should talk to about this?"**
   - Helps you recruit more participants

**Thank them:**
```
This was incredibly helpful. Your honest feedback is exactly what we need to build something that actually works for people like you.

Your compensation will be sent to [email] within [timeframe].

If you have any follow-up thoughts, feel free to email me at [email].

Thanks again!
```

## The Mom Test Rules

Before every interview, remember these principles from Rob Fitzpatrick's "The Mom Test":

### Rule 1: Talk About Their Life, Not Your Idea

❌ "I'm building a tool to help you manage tasks. What do you think?"
✅ "How do you currently keep track of tasks and to-dos?"

### Rule 2: Ask About Specifics in the Past, Not Generics or Opinions About the Future

❌ "Would you use a voice-to-task feature?"
✅ "Tell me about the last time you tried to quickly capture a task. What did you do?"

### Rule 3: Talk Less, Listen More

**The 80/20 rule:** User should talk 80% of the time, you talk 20%.

If you're explaining, pitching, or defending your product, you're doing it wrong.

## Red Flags During the Interview

Watch for these warning signs that the data might not be reliable:

🚩 **Compliment Mode:** "This is great! I love it!"
- **Fix:** "Thanks! But what would make you actually use this vs. your current solution?"

🚩 **Hypothetical Future:** "I would definitely use this!"
- **Fix:** "Help me understand - when's the last time you tried to solve this problem?"

🚩 **Feature Requests:** "You should add X, Y, and Z!"
- **Fix:** "Interesting. Walk me through why you'd need X. What problem does that solve for you?"

🚩 **Too Polite:** Never saying anything negative
- **Fix:** "Feel free to be harsh. What's the most frustrating part of [current solution]?"

🚩 **Vague Generalities:** "Users want a better experience"
- **Fix:** "Tell me about the last specific time you used [product]. What happened?"

## Advanced Techniques

### Silence is Golden

After someone finishes answering, wait 5-10 seconds before asking the next question.

They'll often fill the silence with deeper, more honest reflections.

### The "Five Whys"

When someone mentions a problem, ask "Why?" five times to get to the root cause:

- User: "I don't use that feature."
- You: "Why not?"
- User: "It's too complicated."
- You: "Why is it complicated?"
- User: "There are too many steps."
- You: "Why are there too many steps a problem?"
- User: "I'm usually on my phone when I need it."
- You: "Why does being on your phone make the steps harder?"
- User: "Because I'm in meetings or talking to customers."

**Aha!** The real problem is interruption, not complexity.

### The Commitment Test

When someone says they'd use/pay for something:

"If I had this ready tomorrow, would you give me your credit card right now?"

Their reaction tells you if they're serious or just being polite.

## Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake #1: Leading Questions

**Bad:** "Wouldn't it be great if you could sync with one click?"
**Good:** "How do you currently handle syncing?"

### ❌ Mistake #2: Talking More Than Listening

If you're talking >20% of the time, you're doing it wrong.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Interviewing Friends/Family

They want you to succeed and will lie to be encouraging. Always recruit strangers who fit your target profile.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Asking Users to Do Your Job

**Bad:** "What features should we build?"
**Good:** "Walk me through the last time you tried to do [task]. What was hard about it?"

### ❌ Mistake #5: Stopping at Surface-Level Problems

Don't accept "I want it faster" as the answer. Dig into why speed matters and what they're really trying to accomplish.

### ❌ Mistake #6: Not Recording

Memory is unreliable. Always record (with permission) so you can focus on listening.

## After Your Interviews

Once you've completed 5-8 interviews, use `/user-research-synthesis` to turn your raw data into actionable product insights.

The real work isn't the interview - it's the synthesis.

---

**Remember:** The goal of user interviews is not validation. It's discovery. You're not trying to hear what you want; you're trying to learn what you need to know.
