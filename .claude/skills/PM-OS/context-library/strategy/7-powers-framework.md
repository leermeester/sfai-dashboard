## The 7 Powers

**Definition:** A "power" is a structural advantage that enables persistent differential returns (higher profits) over time.

### 1. Scale Economies

**What:** Per-unit costs decline as production volume increases
**When:** Mature, capital-intensive businesses
**Example:** Amazon (warehousing, logistics), Walmart (supplier negotiations)
**Test:** Does higher volume = lower cost per unit?

---

### 2. Network Effects

**What:** Value increases as more users join
**When:** Products with user-to-user interaction
**Example:** Facebook, LinkedIn, Slack (more users = more value)
**Test:** Does adding a user increase value for existing users?

---

### 3. Counter-Positioning

**What:** New business model that incumbents can't copy without damaging their existing business
**When:** Disruptive innovations
**Example:** Netflix (streaming) vs Blockbuster (rentals), Vanguard (low-cost index funds) vs active management
**Test:** Would the incumbent lose money copying you?

---

### 4. Switching Costs

**What:** Cost or pain of switching to a competitor prevents churn
**When:** Deep integration, data lock-in, learning curves
**Example:** Salesforce (CRM data), Adobe (file formats), SAP (ERP systems)
**Test:** How painful is it for customers to leave?

---

### 5. Branding

**What:** Durable attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering
**When:** Emotional connections, status, trust
**Example:** Apple (premium perception), Nike (athlete association), Tiffany (luxury)
**Test:** Do customers pay more for the brand alone?

---

### 6. Cornered Resource

**What:** Preferential access to a coveted resource
**When:** Unique assets, exclusive partnerships, regulatory advantages
**Example:** Pixar (top animation talent), Google (search data), pharma patents
**Test:** Do you have exclusive access to something competitors can't get?

---

### 7. Process Power

**What:** Embedded company processes that can't be easily copied
**When:** Operational excellence, complex workflows
**Example:** Toyota Production System, LVMH luxury craftsmanship
**Test:** Is your process difficult to replicate?

## How to Use This Framework

**For strategy work:**
1. Identify which power(s) you currently have
2. Identify which power(s) you're building toward
3. Design your product/strategy to strengthen these powers

**For competitive analysis:**
1. Map competitors' powers
2. Identify where you can counter-position
3. Avoid competing head-on against stronger powers

**For PRDs:**
- Reference which power this feature strengthens
- Example: "This integration strengthens our Switching Costs power by making migration harder"
