## What is a Growth Loop?

**Definition:** A self-reinforcing cycle where outputs become inputs, driving compounding growth.

**Growth Loop ≠ Funnel:**
- **Funnel:** Linear (awareness → signup → activation → paid)
- **Loop:** Circular (users → actions → outputs → new users → repeat)

**Key insight:** Sustainable growth comes from loops, not one-time campaigns.

## The 13 Growth Loop Types

### 1. Viral Loop (Inherent)

**Mechanic:** Product requires inviting others to work
**Example:** Zoom, Slack, Figma
**Formula:** User invites team → Team joins → Team invites more teams

**Requirements:**
- Collaborative product
- Viral coefficient k > 1
- Low friction invite flow

---

### 2. User-Generated Content (UGC) Loop

**Mechanic:** Users create content that attracts new users
**Example:** YouTube, Medium, TikTok, Pinterest
**Formula:** User creates content → Content ranks in search → New users find content → New users create content

**Requirements:**
- Content creation tools
- SEO/discoverability
- Content quality controls

---

### 3. Marketplace Loop (Two-Sided)

**Mechanic:** More supply attracts demand, more demand attracts supply
**Example:** Airbnb, Uber, Etsy
**Formula:** Hosts list properties → More inventory attracts guests → More guests attract hosts

**Requirements:**
- Balance both sides
- High-quality supply
- Trust/safety systems

---

### 4. Platform/Ecosystem Loop

**Mechanic:** Developers build on platform, expanding capabilities
**Example:** Shopify apps, Slack integrations, Notion templates
**Formula:** Developers build integrations → Integrations attract users → More users attract developers

**Requirements:**
- Developer APIs
- Marketplace/discovery
- Revenue share incentive

---

### 5. Paid Acquisition Loop

**Mechanic:** Revenue funds ads that acquire more revenue-generating users
**Example:** Mobile games, D2C brands
**Formula:** Acquire user → User generates LTV → Reinvest in CAC → Acquire more users

**Requirements:**
- LTV > CAC
- Attribution tracking
- Optimization systems

---

### 6. Sales Loop (B2B)

**Mechanic:** Revenue funds sales team that closes more deals
**Example:** Salesforce, enterprise SaaS
**Formula:** Close deal → Hire sales rep → Close more deals → Hire more reps

**Requirements:**
- Scalable sales playbook
- Repeatable deal process
- Predictable CAC payback

---

### 7. Content Marketing Loop

**Mechanic:** Content ranks in search, driving organic traffic
**Example:** HubSpot blog, Canva templates, Moz SEO guides
**Formula:** Publish content → Ranks in search → Drives signups → More data for content → Better content

**Requirements:**
- SEO expertise
- Content production capacity
- Product-content fit

---

### 8. Referral Loop (Explicit)

**Mechanic:** Users refer friends for rewards
**Example:** Dropbox (get space), Airbnb (travel credits)
**Formula:** User refers friend → Friend signs up → User gets reward → Refers more friends

**Requirements:**
- Compelling incentive
- Easy sharing mechanics
- Fraud prevention

---

### 9. "Powered By" Loop

**Mechanic:** Outputs show branding, driving awareness
**Example:** Loom videos, Typeform surveys, Notion pages
**Formula:** User creates output → Shares output → Recipients see branding → Recipients sign up

**Requirements:**
- Shareable outputs
- Non-intrusive branding
- Quality outputs (or brand hurts)

---

### 10. Community Loop

**Mechanic:** Community creates value that attracts new members
**Example:** Reddit, Discord servers, Stack Overflow
**Formula:** Members contribute → Content attracts lurkers → Lurkers become members → More contributions

**Requirements:**
- Moderation
- Quality standards
- Engagement incentives

---

### 11. Notification Loop

**Mechanic:** Notifications bring users back, driving engagement
**Example:** LinkedIn connection requests, Facebook notifications
**Formula:** User A takes action → User B gets notification → User B returns → User B takes action → User A gets notification

**Requirements:**
- Permission for notifications
- Relevant triggers (not spammy)
- Re-engagement value

---

### 12. Data Network Effect Loop

**Mechanic:** More usage → Better product → More usage
**Example:** Waze (traffic data), Spotify (recommendations), Google (search results)
**Formula:** Users provide data → Product improves → Attracts more users → More data

**Requirements:**
- Data collection infrastructure
- ML/algorithms that improve with data
- Visible product improvements

---

### 13. Financial Incentive Loop

**Mechanic:** Users earn money, driving adoption and retention
**Example:** Uber/Lyft (driver earnings), Substack (writer revenue), Gumroad (creator sales)
**Formula:** User earns money → Invites customers → Earns more money → Tells other potential earners

**Requirements:**
- Real earning potential
- Transparent economics
- Payment infrastructure

---

## How to Choose Your Growth Loop

### Step 1: Match to Product Type

**Collaborative tools:** Viral Loop (1)
**Content platforms:** UGC Loop (2) + Content Marketing (7)
**Marketplaces:** Marketplace Loop (3)
**Developer platforms:** Platform Loop (4)
**Ad-monetized:** Paid Acquisition Loop (5)
**Enterprise SaaS:** Sales Loop (6) + Referral (8)

---

### Step 2: Assess Loop Strength

**Strong loops have:**
- ✅ Short cycle time (days, not months)
- ✅ High conversion rate at each step
- ✅ Compounding effect (accelerates over time)
- ✅ Hard to replicate (defensible)

**Weak loops have:**
- ❌ Long cycle time (months to complete)
- ❌ Low conversion rates (leaky)
- ❌ Linear growth (doesn't compound)
- ❌ Easy to copy (no moat)

---

### Step 3: Build Loops Sequentially

**Don't build all loops at once.**

**Example: Notion's evolution**
1. **Phase 1:** UGC Loop (templates attract users)
2. **Phase 2:** Viral Loop (team collaboration)
3. **Phase 3:** Platform Loop (integrations/API)
4. **Phase 4:** Content Marketing Loop (SEO-driven blog)

**Focus:** Master one loop before adding another

---

## Loop Metrics to Track

**For each loop, track:**

```
1. Cycle time - How long to complete one loop?
2. Loop efficiency - What % complete each step?
3. Output multiplier - How many new inputs per cycle?
4. Cumulative impact - Total growth attributed to loop?
```

**Example: Viral Loop Metrics**
- Cycle time: 7 days (invite → signup)
- Invitation rate: 0.5 invites per user
- Acceptance rate: 40%
- Viral coefficient (k): 0.5 × 0.4 = 0.2 (needs improvement!)

**Goal:** k > 1 for exponential growth

---

## Combining Multiple Loops

**Best growth companies stack loops:**

**Example: Airbnb**
1. Marketplace Loop (hosts ↔ guests)
2. UGC Loop (listings rank in search)
3. Referral Loop (travel credits)
4. Content Marketing Loop (city guides)

**Example: Slack**
1. Viral Loop (team collaboration)
2. Platform Loop (integrations)
3. Sales Loop (enterprise deals)
4. Community Loop (Slack communities)

---
