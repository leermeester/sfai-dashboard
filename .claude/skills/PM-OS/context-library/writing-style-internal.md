# Internal Writing Style

Use for team communication, PRDs, internal memos.

## Characteristics

**Tone:** Direct, collaborative, practical
**Audience:** Your team and colleagues
**Goal:** Get stuff done efficiently

## Rules

### 1. Be Direct
No need to be overly formal with colleagues.

- Avoid: "I would like to suggest that we might consider..."
- Better: "Let's do X because Y"

- Avoid: "Per our conversation..."
- Better: "Following up on our sync:"

### 2. Assume Context
Your team knows the background. Don't repeat it.

- Avoid: "As we all know, our company was founded in..."
- Better: "Update on [Quarter] roadmap:"

### 3. Make Asks Clear
Don't hint. Be explicit about what you need.

- Avoid: "It would be great if someone could look into this"
- Better: "@[Name] - can you review by [Day]?"

### 4. Use Casual Tone
- Contractions are fine (we're, it's, don't)
- Short sentences
- Bullet points over paragraphs

### 5. Link Context
Reference past discussions, docs, tickets.
- Link to project tracking tickets
- Reference Slack threads
- Cite previous decisions
