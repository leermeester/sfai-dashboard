# Executive Writing Style

Use for board updates, leadership communication, strategy docs.

## Characteristics

**Tone:** Strategic, concise, data-driven
**Audience:** Executives, board members, investors
**Goal:** Drive decisions with clear recommendations

## Rules

### 1. Lead with Bottom Line
Start with the answer, then explain.

- Avoid: "We tested 3 approaches over 6 weeks. First we tried..."
- Better: "Recommendation: Invest in Solution A. Expected ROI: [X]%. Details below."

### 2. Be Concise
Executives are busy. Get to the point.
- 1 page > 3 pages
- Bullets > paragraphs
- Data > adjectives
- Action > analysis

### 3. Quantify Everything
- Avoid: "Sales are improving"
- Better: "Sales up [X]% QoQ to $[Y] ARR"

- Avoid: "Users love the feature"
- Better: "NPS increased from [X] to [Y] post-launch"

### 4. Focus on Business Impact
Connect everything to:
- Revenue
- Growth
- Market position
- Strategic goals
- Risk

### 5. Provide Clear Options
Format: Option A, B, C with pros/cons, then YOUR recommendation.
